Been looking around for a decent dotfiles project that sets up everything but wasn't really getting anywhere
as the projects were always focussed on one dimension. In this dotfiles, I attempt to use open source solutions
to have a one-stop solution.


## Requirements

Currently the setup does not install the following. So you have to do it yourself.

- [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
- [spf-vim](http://vim.spf13.com/)


## Installation

Just run the following command:

    http://j.mp/abhidots -L -o - | sh

## What is in it

### VIM Setup

It customizes [spf-13 vim](http://vim.spf13.com/) for you.

### ZSH Setup

Adds some more settings for `zsh`
